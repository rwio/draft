# Unit 1

## INSTRUCTIONS TO STUDENT

### Summary writting

*Summary writting* is a test of your ability to find the important points in a piece of writting and put them together. To write a *summary*, you must be able to do two things. You must be able to understand what you read, and to put ideas together. *Comprehension* is a test of your ability to understand what you read. *Writing* is a test of your ability to put ideas together. So *Summary writting* and *comprehension* are closely related to each other.

Unit 1 contains twenty-four short pieces. There are some questions under each piece. Your answers to these questions will be in short, simple sentences. Put your answers together. In this way, you will make a short paragraph. Your paragraph will be a *summary* of the piece.

Before you begin each exercise, read these instructions carefully. Read them each time you begin a new piece. They are very important.

### How to work

1. Read the piece carefully two or three times. Make sure you understand it.
2. Write an answer to each question. Each answer must be *a complete sentence*.
3. Your answers to the questions must follow one another. Together, they will make a complete paragraph.
4. Read through your work and correct your mistakes.
5. Count the number of words in your paragraph. Words like 'the', 'a', etc. count as single words. Words which are joined by a hyphen (e.g. hold-up) also count as single words. Do not go over the word limit. At the end of your paragraph write the number of words that you have used.

### Example

Work through this example carefully and then try to do the exercise in Unit 1 in the same way.

#### Granny Forbes

Mrs. Forbes was very old and very poor.

### Key structures and special difficulties

When you finish the exercise in **Summary writting**, go on to the language exercises that follow. The information under the title **Key structures** gives you advice about important problems in grammar. The information under the title **Special difficulties** gives you advice about particular problems. The twenty-four passages in Unit 1 will help you to understand these problems and to do the language exercises.
